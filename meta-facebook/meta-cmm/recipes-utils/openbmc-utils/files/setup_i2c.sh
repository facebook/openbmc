##### NOTE #########################################################
# - When adding new devices, always add to end of the list here
#   so any other dependencies that are hard coded with GPIO
#   will not break.
# - Although technically all the i2c devices can be created by using
#   device tree, we prefer to do it here, mainly because:
#     * it's easier to control the order of device creation.
#     * a majority of i2c devices are located on line/fabric cards,
#       and it's easier to control device creation/removal and add
#       hot-plug support in the future.
