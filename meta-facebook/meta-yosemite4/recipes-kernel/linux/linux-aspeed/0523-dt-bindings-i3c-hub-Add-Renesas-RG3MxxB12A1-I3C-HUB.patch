+description: |
+  I3C HUB is smart device which provides multiple functionality:
+  * enabling voltage compatibility across I3C Controller and Target devices,
+  * bus capacitance isolation
+  * address conflict isolation
+  * I3C port expansion
+  * two controllers in a single I3C bus
+  * I3C and SMBus device compatibility
+  * GPIO expansion
+
+  Having such big number of features, there is a need to have some DT knobs to tell the I3C HUB
+  driver which features shall be enabled and how they shall be configured. I3C HUB driver read,
+  validate DT knobs and set corresponding registers with the right way to satisfy user requests from
+  DT.
+
+  All the DT properties for I3C HUB are located under dedicated (for I3C HUB) DT entry. I3C HUB DT
+  entry structure is aligned with regular I3C device DT entry described in i3c.yaml.
