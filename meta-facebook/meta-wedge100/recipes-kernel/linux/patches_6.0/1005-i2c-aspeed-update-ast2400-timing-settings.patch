Subject: [PATCH] i2c: aspeed: update ast2400 timing settings

Summary:
We have seen consistent I2C transaction failures in wedge100 i2c-3/4/9
busses, and such errors can be fixed by adjusting I2C setup/hold time in
I2CD04 register.

Test Plan:
verified i2c-3, i2c-4 and i2c-9 after chassis power cycle: all devices
are functioning properly (devices are not reachable without the patch):
  - tmp75 (3-0048, 3-004a, 3-004b, 3-004c)
  - com_e_driver (4-0033)
  - tpm_i2c_infineon (9-0020)
