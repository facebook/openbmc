# The following will enable a build capable of verified-boot.
# Images and the resultant flash are always built as a FIT (firmware image).
# When verified-boot is enabled, the U-Boot firmware attempts to be built as
# a ROM part and upgradable part using the SPL options.
#
# A public key must be configured, which will be built into the resultant ROM.
# Most build logic is represented in the U-Boot recipes.
