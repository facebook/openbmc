### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          sensor-setup
# Required-Start:    power-on
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start:     S
# Default-Stop:
# Short-Description: Power on micro-server
### END INIT INFO

# Eventually, this will be used to configure the various (mostly
# i2c-based) sensors, once we have a kernel version that supports
# doing this more dynamically.
#
# For now, we're using it to install the lm75 and pmbus module so that it
# can detect the fourth temperature sensor, which is located
# on the uServer, which doesn't get power until power-on executes.
#
# Similarly, the pmbus sensor seems to have an easier time of
# detecting the NCP4200 buck converters after poweron.  This has not
# been carefully explored.
